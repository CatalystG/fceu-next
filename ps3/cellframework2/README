			CELLFRAMEWORK Mk. II
==============================================================================
A framework with the following goals:

* Provide an easy and clean framework for porting over applications to PS3.
* Fully functional video/audio/input drivers written in C that can be 
  implemented by the porter.
* File system browser.
* Logger interface (Netlogger only so far), great for debugging.
